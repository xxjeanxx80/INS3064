We make it easy for you to access the knowledge and learning resources you need — anytime, anywhere. <br>
VNU-IS Library has been serving students and faculty since 2023, with the mission of providing high-quality academic and reference materials at no cost, while fostering a culture of lifelong learning and research excellence within the VNU-IS community. <br><br>

<strong>Why use the VNU-IS Library?</strong><br>
Buying or accessing learning materials individually can be costly and inconvenient. That’s why the VNU-IS Library is dedicated to giving you free and convenient access to thousands of academic books, journals, and digital resources.
We are not just a place to borrow books — we are a learning companion that supports your academic journey. Based in the heart of VNU, the library aims to make learning more accessible, collaborative, and inspiring.

As we grow, we continue to expand beyond traditional book lending to offer a digital platform where students can explore e-books, research papers, theses, and other academic materials across all disciplines. Every resource is carefully curated to ensure quality, relevance, and value for your study and research needs. <br>
Learn More. Discover More. Grow Smarter!
